ðŸŽ¯ What requirements did you achieve?
ðŸŽ¯ Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
ðŸŽ¯ If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?

I think I achieved all the requirements apart from the keyboard function. I didnt achieve this one because I didnt understand how to make the buttons for it. I was able to scroll through the images with my left and right arrow but then my thumbnail container all changed and I couldnt figure out how to change it all back.

My general feeling of how this assignment went is not great I have came back to it and it no longer works the way it was after I tried deploying it to render. The stylesheet couldnt be read due to a MIME type or something along them lines which has threw me off completely
