ðŸŽ¯ What requirements did you achieve?
ðŸŽ¯ Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
ðŸŽ¯ If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?

I think I achieved all the requirements apart from the keyboard function. I didnt achieve this one because I didnt understand how to make the buttons for it. I was able to scroll through the images with my left and right arrow but then my thumbnail container all changed and I couldnt figure out how to change it all back.

My general feeling of how this assignment went is not great I have came back to it and it no longer works the way it was after I tried deploying it to render. The stylesheet couldnt be read due to a MIME type or something along them lines which has threw me off completely. On Further debugging the reason it wasnt working properly was because vite had somehow been unistalled from my assignment while I was away. CSS for me in this assignment has been a nightmare I have struggled trying to gte the first picture to be the same as the rest and not be so big but everything I have tried hasnt worked, this is something I am going to look to improve on.
I have struggled really hard in this assignment but I now know what it is I really need to work on to improve in those areas. I thought this assignment would be something I would be good at but it has been a struggle this week. I am looking to improve alot for future assignments and future work.
